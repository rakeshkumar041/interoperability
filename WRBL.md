## What

WRBL is our experimental product to test out different use cases and discover new avenues while expanding and creating for different platforms. 
It’s an interface that allows the users to generate 3d garments using photographs and 3d models to create wearables that are compatible across multiple platforms.

## How

Here is the user journey based on 3 different development stages mentioned in our roadmap section below. Currently we are at stage 1 of development

Users can upload photographs and 3d models and then select the platforms they require compatibility for.
With a small wait period and delivery cycle we will create the garments compatible with different platforms with relevant file types

## Roadmap
Each stage will shorten the creation process and solve for feasibility in the creation process with tech and 3d developments.

We have released an alpha version of this platform for early access.

<u>We’d be happy if you can collaborate in testing and feedback for the same<u/)

## Stage1; Manual conversion- 

## Goal :
**3d:**  To understand different use cases and develop new methodologies while exploring the creation process and understanding the users. Keep researching and adding new platforms to the list
**Tech:** research on available methods to link and verify assets and NFT’s

## Stage 2; Standardized formats (2-3)


## Goal: 
## 3d: 

-To ease the creation process by developing on 2-3 standard formats and automate the process for creating further variations for other platforms

## Tech: 

-To have an integrated NFT marketplace where the users can directly sell their created wearables. 
-To create a system of automating platform specific edits to some pre-decided file types

## Stage 3; Unified format/system/ tool, 
## Goal: 
**3d:** To align the collection and creation process with Universal standards 
**Tech:** Develop necessary tools to automate the creation process
