# Exploring Interoperable Digital Fashion Wearables

## Intro

Welcome to our GitHub profile! We are a digital fashion/ wearables platform that creates hyper-realistic 3D digital wearables which can be worn on avatars across multiple metaverse platforms and online games. We are proud to showcase some of our work on this page and invite you to collaborate with us!

## ü•Ö Our Goal

We aim to 

- Develop interoperable wearables that are compatible with different platforms and standards.
- Support a variety of use cases and scenarios.
- Enhance the user‚Äôs experience as well as the creator‚Äôs experience.
- Promote co-creation to develop the ecosystem as a whole.

## What interoperability is to us

We define interoperability in 3 stages:

  ### 1. Airdrops/Linked wearables: 
  Assets/NFT‚Äôs like wearables can be bought and used in as many platforms possible using connected airdrops for NFT‚Äôs
      
  ### 2. API Integration:
  API that works with multiple metaverse platforms allowing
seamless exchange of information on their assets where users can move smoothly from one virtual world to another

  ### 3. Open Standards: 
  Universal Standards & Open-Source Technology implementation

## üó∫Ô∏è Our Projects and Roadmap


Our experiments and projects are for the greater goal of interoperable fashion in the metaverse. We‚Äôve shared our findings and research through some of our projects such as:

  - ### Virtual try ons 
    - A collection of 3d garments that anyone can virtually try on their photographs
