## What

Clonex dresser is an easy fitting tool where different avatar types can be dressed with any wearable. Initially we will be creating for the clonex avatars and later open support for various other avatars

## Why

All avatar assets in the long run need customizability along with interoperability in order to stay relevant in evolving digital ecosystems and metaverses. They should allow for users to express their identity.

We’ve seen VRM as a format/ file type of wearables that is accepted by many platforms and also packs in capabilities such as facial blendshapes and deform bones. This enhances the experience for the users. However, VRM files are avatar files and once created, it’s not easy to change attributes like skin color, hair color, clothing etc.

There are tools like [VROID](https://vroid.com/en/studio) out there but the creation process is a little technical for an average user, and moreover it does not allow for creating easy custom wearables and accessories.   

To solve the problem of repetitive work for the 3d creation process, we realized there should be an easy fitting tool where different avatar types can be dressed with any wearable
This led us to experiment with creating an easy wearable editor for VRM and GLTF avatars.

We’re starting with clonex avatar support because the values of the creative community at rtfkt align with ours.

## How

We want a simple drag and drop interface that allows users to upload any avatar and dress it with our wearables.

## Roadmap

We’ve started the development with support for Clonex avatars.Eventually we plan on adding support for multiple body types
