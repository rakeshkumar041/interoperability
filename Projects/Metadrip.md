## Why Metadrip

We wanted to start with a small collection to explore designs that are challenging and different in texture, material, shape and form. We wanted  to see how closely this type of a collection can be created for different platforms while maintaining the fidelity and feel of the original to whatever possible extent.

## Our Goal

We look at this project as an experimental collection to explore all possible avenues of creating an interoperable wearable that can seamlessly be taken into different metaverses along with all the traits, bells and whistles that the original NFT would promise. 
We are exploring different workflows and integrations to make the best use of current systems and also explore the development of better and easier systems of working for both the creators and the users.

## Metadrip roadmap:

Keeping in mind the technical constraints and challenges of what is possible today versus what might be possible tomorrow, weâ€™ve divided our roadmap into three milestones.
