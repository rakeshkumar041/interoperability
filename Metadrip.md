## What is Meta Drip?
  - A collection of 12 designs created by independent artists using different softwares and design principles. 
  - Each design explores unique attributes/properties from material type, pattern style, silhouette and more.
  - The collection was created to make it accessible in as many web2 and web3 platforms as possible and give its NFT holders exclusive access.

## Why Metadrip

We started with 12 wearables to explore challenging designs in texture, material, shape and form.
We wanted to see how closely this type of a collection can be created for different platforms while maintaining the fidelity and feel of the original.

## Our Goal

  - To create a wearable that can seamlessly be taken into different metaverses along with all the traits, bells and whistles that the original NFT would promise.
  - Explore different workflows and integrations to make the best use of current NFT verification systems.
  - Develop better and easier systems of working for both the creators and the platforms.

### 3d Development

  **Goal**
   - To be Aligned with stage 1 of interoperability mentioned [here](https://github.com/xrcouture/interoperability#1-airdropslinked-wearables)
    
   - To create wearables for different metaverse platforms and discover new tools and avenues for streamlining the process
    
  **Work**
  
   - Deployed a collection of 12 wearable NFT’s and released it to the public for minting and added in utilities and deployed the collection for compatibility with platforms like: 
  
    1. Decentraland
    
    2. Snapchat AR
    
    3. Zepeto
    
    4. Clonex

   - And created for other platforms like:
  
    1. Roblox
    
    2. Sandbox
    
    3. Zepeto
    
    4. Minecraft
    
    5. Monaverse
    
    6. Megaverse
    
    7. Vroid VRM
    
    8. Clonex
    
    9. Metahuman
    
    10. Minecraft
    
    11. OVR

   - We’ve documented all the technical aspects of creating 3d wearable [here](https://github.com/xrcouture/interoperability/blob/main/3dDevelopmentProcess.md)


  - Used each platform's unique capabilities to enhance the experience
  
  - **For example:** Adding interactions to activate an animation in snapchat for the cosmic boom wearable, using pose detection.

  - Process of creating for different AR platforms [here](https://github.com/xrcouture/interoperability/blob/main/ARWearables.md)


 **Learnings:**

  - Creating 3d assets which are compatible for various platforms is a time consuming and tedious process. 
  
  We’ve drawn a more streamlined process for creating 3d assets
  
  https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122074866/236478737-0e418885-424a-4a52-b00b-921f38ec83a8.mp4
  
  - There are a bunch of constraints in creating wearables for different platform
    Some platforms like Roblox and Sandbox require a type of a creator pass or a UGC pass. 
    These passes are not easy to get for all creators/studios. Hence we  believe the answer lies in open UGC opportunities.
    
 
 ### Tech Development
 
  **Goal:**
  
   - To upload wearables in different web 2 and web 3 platforms and make it accessible to the users easily.
   - To allow claiming and airdrops for wearables using private access links for the NFT holders.

  **Work:** 
  
  - We’ve created a widget integration for accessing 3d wearables on other platforms
  - The users can use the widget to claim Decentraland Wearables by a single click
  - The wearables can also be used as AR snapchat filters by scanning the QR code available on the widget
  - The widget also allows the user to try virtual photoshoot by uploading their photo
  - The user can also download the 3d files of these wearables

  </div>


  **Learnings:**
  
  - Verification methods for an ownership of an NFT on different platforms is clunky since all platforms function on different blockchains
  - Integrations with different platforms requires some kind of an API which allows us to do so – which in most cases metaverses currently don't provide
  - It is not easy to use linked wearables as it requires approval from the community for each collection
  - The wearables or asset cannot be sold in our own platform or marketplace

  ### 3D Development
  
  **Goal:**
  
   - Create collections for further more platforms
   - Explore VRM and other standard file types

  **Work and Learnings:**
  
  - To solve the problem of repetitive work for the 3d creation process, we realized there should be an easy fitting tool where different avatar types can be dressed with any wearable
  - This led us to experiment with creating an easy wearable editor for VRM and GLTF avatars.

  **Tech Development:** 

  **Goal:**

  - To align with [stage 2](https://github.com/xrcouture/interoperability#2-api-integration) of interoperability
  - To use an API that allows any metaverse platform to integrate it within their platform and the user can seamlesly access their wearables that are part of the another environment 

  **Work and Learnings: Case study**
  
  - We have collaborated with megaverse which is on the polygon blockchain and deployed our metadrip collection on the platform using our API to directly verify NFT holders on the platform and seamlessly use our wearables for their avatars directly on connecting their wallets.
  You can read more about our API [Here](https://github.com/xrcouture/metadrip/blob/main/APIdocs.md)

  - We want a simple drag and drop interface that allows users to upload any avatar and dress it with our wearables.
  We’ve started the development with support for Clonex avatars. Eventually we plan on adding support for multiple body types

### 3d and Tech Development

  **Goal:**
  
   - To align ourselves with [stage 3](https://github.com/xrcouture/interoperability#3-open-standards) of interoperability.
   - Create/align with a system/ tool /standard where an asset needs to only be created once and then can be taken into different platforms.
  
  **Ideas:**	
  

   If we just brainstorm on what a truly interoperable solution could look like , the below mentioned 2 solutions seem to emerge broadly. We think the solution largely would be a combination of both
  

**A] A tool** 

That understand the way each platform avatar works and categorize them on the basis of mesh/voxel/sprite sheet/2d

  - That can efficiently read different body type standards from different platforms and deform the 3d asset according to those body types while automatically rigging and skinning the asset according to the shape and proximity of the wearable meshes from the rig.

  - Some tools with interesting workflows in this context:

  [Auto fitting capabilities in marvelous designer](https://support.marvelousdesigner.com/hc/en-us/articles/900004342823-Auto-Fitting)
 
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122074866/235134913-07d3fa80-8a77-4b5c-a9e4-6e8a6ca7a108.png" width="100%"/>

  - If the target platform is voxel based- It should know how to assign and simplify the meshes to achieve that voxel look with the appropriate voxel resolution needed for the platforms, while assigning appropriate colors to the geometry.
  - With capabilities to accurately render sprite sheets in different styles/ requirements
  - With capabilities of mesh optimization according to the fidelity of the desired platforms
  - With capabilities of understanding different shader types of different platforms and creating relevant material setups for each for best possible quality and visuals.
  - With export capabilities that can format the textures, naming conventions/ and other specifics according to the platforms requirements.

Something like this will cover the bare basics of creating a 3d wearable asset for different avatars across platforms. But with NFT’s there is an added layer of rarity that in a lot of cases is powered by certain capabilities in games- like a wearable that allows you to fly in one metaverse might need an equivalent capability in another.

[We’ve visualized how a wearable of the future might  look like and the capabilities it might have](https://github.com/xrcouture/interoperability/blob/main/walkInOneWearable.md)



**B] Universal standards** 

The second solution can be a filetype which can be a standardized solution across all metaverses such a filetype may bake in all the necessary information that the asset might need to function well in any platform, including all the metadata it needs to be compatible and make use of all the features native to that platform.


We have seen VRM as a very versatile format in this regard since it allows the users to add in a lot of interesting features/ interactions to the avatars like- deform bones, particle effects as well as blendshapes, etc. 


<div align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122074866/235296430-374a68cb-6b1f-4a31-88b8-8e32205d64df.gif" width="auto" height="40%"/>
</div>


But the major constraint here is that it is an avatar standard and does not allow easy customizability for the outfit/skin color/hair etc.

There are a lot of easy creator tools that have simplified the process of creating VRM’s like [VROID](https://vroid.com/en/studio), but are very limited and still not as intuitive for any average user.


All this led us to experiment with creating an easy wearable editor for VRM and GLTF avatars.

We want a simple drag and drop interface that allows users to upload any avatar and dress it with our wearables.

We’ve started the development with support for Clonex avatars.Eventually we plan on adding support for multiple body types
