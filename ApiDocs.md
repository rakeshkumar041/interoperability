Welcome to the documentation of the api that is used to achieve interoperability of digital fashion wearables across different platforms

## Goal:

To achieve interoperability of digital fashions wearables across web2 and web3 platform

## Metaverse/Web2 platforms

  The platfroms allow their users to import their digital fashion wearables that are minted/created outside their environment to use it in their environment

## Prerequisites:
1.	Get the 3d wearables specifications of the platforms


## Origin NFT

we are not going to mint separate NFTs for each platform, instead mint a single NFT known as **Origin NFT** and link multiple 3d assets and it schema to it. 
An ownership of the NFT means, the collective ownership of the wearables in its linked metaverse platform


## Transferring ownership

The ownership of NFT can be transferred to other user, which means the new owner has access to the wearables in all these platforms. 
It is not possible to transfer ownership of a wearable from only one platform. The NFTs can be sold from the WRBL platform or from opensea
