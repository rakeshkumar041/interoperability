## Intro

   Our web 2 collection is a digital clothing collection and includes unique designs that explore interesting forms, shapes and textures designed in collaboration by various fashion designers and artists. It includes clothing wearables as well as accessories. These are virtual wearables that can be worn digitally by customers in their photographs and videos to be shared across various digital platforms.
[You can check out the entire collection here](https://web2.xrcouture.com/)

Here are some examples of our virtual fittings:

## Stepping Ahead

Some of the designs were taken one step further by creating them for different platforms:
          
   - One example;  we took Cristal trench and made a live AR experience to virtually try it on in real time. Here you can see both the original virtual try on and its enhanced experience below.

Some of our other recent experiments also involve AI in creating virtual wearables

## Our reason: 
Although we started with creating just virtual try-ons, Now this collection is shaping up to possibly be more. 
Tech is emerging and new workflows are constantly coming up. The interoperable solutions we are building towards at some point would converge many such workflows.
Through this collection we love exploring possibilities with virtual try-ons and experimenting  its intersection with newer technologies.
